# PuntWork Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Code Quality & Testing (Priority: High)
- [ ] Set up PHPUnit testing framework with composer.json
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for all core functions (mappings, batch processing, scheduling)
- [ ] Implement integration tests for import workflows
- [ ] Add code coverage reporting
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline

## Phase 2: Performance Optimization (Priority: High)
- [ ] Implement Redis/object caching for feed data and mappings
- [ ] Optimize database queries with proper indexing
- [ ] Add async processing for large imports using Action Scheduler
- [ ] Implement progressive loading for admin UI
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks and monitoring

## Phase 3: Security & Reliability (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] Add input validation and sanitization for all AJAX endpoints
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for API calls
- [ ] Add CSRF protection beyond nonces
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and logging levels
- [ ] Add data backup/restore functionality

## Phase 4: Feature Enhancements (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] Add real-time import progress via WebSockets
- [ ] Implement feed health monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Add import analytics and reporting dashboard
- [ ] Support for additional feed formats (JSON, CSV)
- [ ] Add job deduplication algorithms

## Phase 5: Developer Experience (Priority: Low)
- [ ] Refactor long functions into smaller, testable units
- [ ] Add PHP type hints and strict typing
- [ ] Implement PSR-4 autoloading
- [ ] Add API documentation with OpenAPI spec
- [ ] Create development Docker environment
