# puntWork Session Context

## Current Date: September 19, 2025
**Last Updated:** September 19, 2025
**Session Focus:** Comprehensive logging system optimization and performance monitoring

## Current Project State

### âœ… Recently Completed
- **JavaScript Modularization**: Split `job-import-admin.js` (237 lines) into 4 focused modules:
  - `job-import-ui.js` - UI updates, progress display, user feedback
  - `job-import-api.js` - AJAX communications with WordPress backend
  - `job-import-logic.js` - Core import processing logic and batch management
  - `job-import-events.js` - Event binding and user interaction handling
- **PHP File Splitting**: Successfully split large monolithic files:
  - `ajax-handlers.php` (91% reduction): Split into `ajax-import-control.php`, `ajax-feed-processing.php`, `ajax-purge.php`
  - `mappings-constants.php` (88% reduction): Split into geographic, salary, icons, fields, schema mappings
  - `import-batch.php` (88% reduction): Split into batch-size-management, import-setup, batch-processing, import-finalization
- **Dynamic Feed URLs**: Implemented dynamic feed URL system using CPT fields (`feed_url` meta field)
- **Coding Standards**: Applied namespace (`Puntwork`), PHPDoc, security validations throughout
- **Comprehensive Logging System**: Complete overhaul of logging infrastructure:
  - `PuntWorkLogger` PHP class with structured logging, data sanitization, admin log integration
  - `PuntWorkJSLogger` JavaScript utility with configurable levels, history tracking, performance monitoring
  - Performance monitoring with AJAX timing, batch processing metrics, memory usage tracking
  - Session-based performance monitoring with error/warning tracking

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- **Testing**: Validating modular JavaScript functionality with enhanced logging
- **Performance Monitoring**: Testing new performance tracking features
- **Documentation**: Updating notes folder with logging patterns and performance monitoring

### ðŸ“‹ Next Priority Tasks
- Test all import features with new modular JavaScript and logging system
- Performance monitoring validation and optimization
- Code review for logging integration opportunities

## Key Technical Context

### Feed URL System
- **Dynamic Implementation**: Feed URLs are now stored in CPT `feed_url` meta field
- **Access Pattern**: `get_post_meta($post_id, 'feed_url', true)`
- **Usage**: Retrieved in `core-structure-logic.php` and used throughout import process
- **Fallback**: System supports fallback domains for robustness

### JavaScript Architecture
- **Modular Pattern**: IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) pattern
- **Global Object**: `PuntWorkJobImportAdmin` combines all modules
- **Dependencies**: Proper loading order: UI â†’ API â†’ Logic â†’ Events â†’ Main
- **Benefits**: Better caching, maintainability, debugging
- **Logging**: `PuntWorkJSLogger` with performance monitoring and session tracking

### PHP Architecture
- **Namespace**: `Puntwork` applied throughout
- **File Organization**: Split by responsibility (AJAX handlers by operation type, mappings by data type)
- **Security**: Nonce verification, input sanitization, output escaping
- **Performance**: External JS files, modular loading
- **Logging**: Centralized `PuntWorkLogger` class with structured logging and admin integration

### Logging System Architecture
- **PHP Logging**: `PuntWorkLogger` class with debug/info/warn/error methods, data sanitization, admin log integration
- **JavaScript Logging**: `PuntWorkJSLogger` with configurable levels, history tracking, performance monitoring
- **Performance Monitoring**: AJAX timing, batch processing metrics, memory usage alerts, session tracking
- **Developer Tools**: `window.pwLog` helper with performance controls and logging management

## Recent Changes Summary
- **Files Modified**: 15+ PHP files, 5 JS files
- **Lines of Code**: Reduced monolithic files by 85-91%
- **Architecture**: Moved from monolithic to modular design
- **Performance**: External JS enables better browser caching

## Session Goals
- Improve Grok efficiency through better context preservation
- Build upon previous learnings and fixes
- Create exponential improvement in development velocity
- Maintain "vibe coding" approach: fun, iterative, optimal

## Quick Reference
- **Main Entry Points**: `job-import.php`, `includes/import-batch.php`
- **AJAX Handlers**: Split across `ajax-*.php` files in includes/
- **Mappings**: Split across `mappings-*.php` files
- **JavaScript**: Modular files in `assets/js/`
- **Feed URLs**: Dynamic from CPT `feed_url` field
