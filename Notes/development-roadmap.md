# Job-Import Plugin: Development Roadmap

## Vision
Turn raw job feeds into seamless WP posts with zero-touch batches, scaling to enterprise via cron/AJAX. Profitable leveraging X Ads and other sources to generate traffic for affiliate marketing referrers, payed .per succesful application on external website with bonus per hire, by 2026.

## Phases Overview
| Phase | Focus | Dependencies | Est. Steps | Status |
|-------|-------|--------------|------------|--------|
| 1: Refactor Snippets to Plugin | Core structure from snippets; no new features | Snippets folder intact | 4-6 | Planning |
| 2: Testing & Polish | Unit tests, security, perf | Phase 1 complete | 3 | Not Started |
| 3: Advanced Features | AI inference, multi-feed | Phase 2 | 5 | Not Started |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Phase 1: Refactor Snippets to Plugin (Detailed Steps)
- **Step 1.1:** [From prior convo: Analyze structure; propose draft changes. Output: Updated includes/core.php with merged snippets 1-1.9.]
  - Progress: [Log date/completion: e.g., "2025-09-12: Proposed; commit hash abc123."]
  - Vision Tie-In: Ensures modularity without breaking feed download/batch logic.
- **Step 1.2:** Integrate admin UI (snippets 2-2.5) into includes/admin.php.
  - ...
- **Step 1.3:** ...
- **Step 1.4:** Full plugin test; remove snippets folder.

Last convo summary: [Quick 2-3 sentences: e.g., "Proposed draft changes for includes/core.php from snippets 1-1.9; no code output yet per instructions."]

Now, tackle Phase 1 Step [X.Y]: [Specific ask: e.g., "Output the full refactored code for includes/core.php, merging snippets 1-1.9 into OOP class. Preserve all features; follow WP best practices. Test via code_execution tool if needed."]
