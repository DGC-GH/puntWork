Heartbeat control - Requested by DGC-GH to prevent timeouts during long imports.
Challenge: Is heartbeat manipulation safe? Could we use smaller batches instead?

Memory limit increases and cache suspension - Requested by DGC-GH for performance.
Challenge: Do these overrides risk server stability? Could we optimize the code instead?

Comprehensive logging - Requested by DGC-GH for debugging.
Challenge: Is extensive logging worth the storage/performance cost? Could we use WordPress debug logs?

Purge functionality - Requested by DGC-GH to clean up data.
Challenge: Is purging necessary, or could we use WordPress trash? Does it risk accidental data loss?

Shortcode for frontend display - Requested by DGC-GH to display jobs on pages.
Challenge: Is a shortcode the best way to display jobs? Could we use blocks or widgets?

Test scheduling functionality - Requested by DGC-GH for cron testing.
Challenge: Is testing needed beyond basic cron verification? Could it be part of core WordPress tools?

ACF Pro integration - Requested by DGC-GH to use ACF for custom fields.
Challenge: Is ACF Pro dependency justified, or could we use core fields? Does it limit portability?


Review and optimize database queries (add indexes on frequently queried columns).

Add database query profiling to identify slow queries.

Optimize batch size dynamically based on performance.



audit current job processing, publishing, updating, skipping and remving algorithm.
analyse the related logs, timestamps and metrics in debug.log.
make conclusion about the efficiency.
refactor the code to increase speed and efficiency of the import process.


replace manual import "Start Import" functionality with scheduled import "Run Now", the goal is to have one import process that can be scheduled or triggered manually

what can you improve that would reduce code duplication, improve maintainability, and ensure consistency across the application?


do 1 and 2 and optionally allow multiple import batches to be processed concurently and the amount of concurent batches to be dynamicly adjusted in synergy with batch size optimizing for speed per job item and import speed in general while avoiding performance related issues.




Recommendations
Add wp_resume_cache_invalidation() after import completion
Check Action Scheduler availability before using concurrent processing
Implement proper locking for status updates
Stream process GUIDs in cleanup instead of loading all into memory
Add iteration limits to processing loops
Implement actual success rate tracking and updates
Standardize on microsecond precision for all timing
Add comprehensive validation for batch size calculations
Implement fallback mechanisms for cron-based continuation
Add feed integrity validation before cleanup operations
