Heartbeat control - Requested by DGC-GH to prevent timeouts during long imports.
Challenge: Is heartbeat manipulation safe? Could we use smaller batches instead?

Memory limit increases and cache suspension - Requested by DGC-GH for performance.
Challenge: Do these overrides risk server stability? Could we optimize the code instead?

Comprehensive logging - Requested by DGC-GH for debugging.
Challenge: Is extensive logging worth the storage/performance cost? Could we use WordPress debug logs?

Purge functionality - Requested by DGC-GH to clean up data.
Challenge: Is purging necessary, or could we use WordPress trash? Does it risk accidental data loss?

Shortcode for frontend display - Requested by DGC-GH to display jobs on pages.
Challenge: Is a shortcode the best way to display jobs? Could we use blocks or widgets?

Test scheduling functionality - Requested by DGC-GH for cron testing.
Challenge: Is testing needed beyond basic cron verification? Could it be part of core WordPress tools?

ACF Pro integration - Requested by DGC-GH to use ACF for custom fields.
Challenge: Is ACF Pro dependency justified, or could we use core fields? Does it limit portability?
