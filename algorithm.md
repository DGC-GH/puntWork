1 - Question every requirement: Attach a specific person’s name to each requirement (not just a department). Then challenge it, no matter who it came from—even if it’s from Musk himself. The goal is to make requirements “less dumb,” as smart people’s ideas can be the most dangerous if unquestioned.

2 - Delete any part of the process you can: Subtract aggressively. Musk advises deleting more than feels comfortable, noting you might add back 10% later—if you don’t, you probably didn’t delete enough.

3 - Simplify and optimize: Only do this after the first two steps to avoid wasting effort on things that shouldn’t exist. He warns: “A common mistake is to simplify and optimize a part or a process that should not exist.”

4 - Accelerate cycle time: Speed up what’s left. Every process can be faster, but only pursue this after questioning and deleting to prevent accelerating flawed steps.

5 - Automate: This comes last. Musk reflects on his own errors: “The big mistake in [my factories] was that I began by trying to automate every step. We should have waited until all the requirements had been questioned, parts and processes deleted, and the bugs were shaken out.” ￼
