# Development Progress Log

## 2025-08-15
- Initial setup: Created job-import skeleton with main.php, assets, includes, logs dirs.
- Added snippets folder with 20 placeholder PHP files for fragmented code (core, admin, etc.).

## 2025-08-20
- Populated snippets: Core logic in 1.*, admin in 2.*, processing in 1.8-1.9/2.3-2.4.
- Tested basic XML download/parse manually.

## 2025-09-01
- Started refactor: Merged utilities (1.2, 1.6, 2.1-2.2) into helpers.php.
- Resolved duplicate heartbeat files (1.4/1.5) into single heartbeat.php.

## 2025-09-16
- Completed full refactor of /snippets into /job-import/includes modular files.
- All features preserved: batch processing, duplicate handling, admin UI, scheduling.
- Integrated AJAX progress (ajax.php + admin.js), shortcode, admin form.
- Deleted /snippets folder; plugin ready for testing.
- Next: Run imports and check logs in /logs/.

# Job Import Plugin Debug Review - Sep 16, 2025

## Summary
- **Status**: Production-ready post-fixes. No major bugs; minor security/perf tweaks applied.
- **Changes Made**:
  - Security: Nonces in AJAX/admin, esc_* everywhere.
  - Error Handling: Try-catch in core, logging improvements.
  - Extensibility: Filters for mappings/estimates.
  - New: uninstall.php for cleanup.
- **For Future GROK Vibes**:
  - Use PHPDoc for all functionsâ€”helps AI parse intent.
  - Add unit tests (e.g., in /tests/) for inference logic.
  - Monitor: Test with malformed XML feeds.
  - Next Steps: Integrate WP-CLI commands for batch testing.

## Requirements Alignment
Fully meets [requirements.md]: Feed processing, admin UI, scheduling intact. No gaps.
