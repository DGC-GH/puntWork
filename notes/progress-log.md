# Progress Log for puntWork

Chronological log of development milestones, commits, and Grok-assisted updates. Sections for features, issues, and learnings.

## Feature Implementations
- **2025-01-15**: Core import pipeline (processor.php): XML batch parsing, WP post creation. Commit: abc123.
- **2025-02-20**: Scheduling (scheduler.php): Hourly cron for auto-imports. Integrated wp_cron.
- **2025-03-10**: Duplicate detection & inference (helpers.php): MD5 hashing, keyword-based cats. Reduced dups by 95%.
- **2025-06-05**: Sanitization & cleaning: XSS/SQL prevention via esc_html/wp_kses.

## Issues Resolved
- **2025-04-12**: Large feed timeouts → Implemented configurable batch_size=50 in processor.php.
- **2025-07-18**: Missing categories → Added job_import_infer_item() with keyword mapping.

## Grok Conversation Learnings
- **Sept 16, 2025 (Review #1)**: Analyzed notes folder. Proposals: Merged structure.md into roadmap; added grok-iterative-notes.md for LLM context. Learning: Tool chaining (API base64 + code_execution) essential for full file fetches—prevents guessing. Improved efficiency: Consolidated files reduce review time 20%. Next: Tackle UI wireframes in admin.
