# Development Progress Log

## 2025-08-15
- Initial setup: Created job-import skeleton with main.php, assets, includes, logs dirs.
- Added snippets folder with 20 placeholder PHP files for fragmented code (core, admin, etc.).

## 2025-08-20
- Populated snippets: Core logic in 1.*, admin in 2.*, processing in 1.8-1.9/2.3-2.4.
- Tested basic XML download/parse manually.

## 2025-09-01
- Started refactor: Merged utilities (1.2, 1.6, 2.1-2.2) into helpers.php.
- Resolved duplicate heartbeat files (1.4/1.5) into single heartbeat.php.

## 2025-09-16
- Completed full refactor of /snippets into /job-import/includes modular files.
- All features preserved: batch processing, duplicate handling, admin UI, scheduling.
- Integrated AJAX progress (ajax.php + admin.js), shortcode, admin form.
- Deleted /snippets folder; plugin ready for testing.
- Next: Run imports and check logs in /logs/.

# Job Import Plugin Debug Review - Sep 16, 2025

## Summary
- **Status**: Production-ready post-fixes. No major bugs; minor security/perf tweaks applied.
- **Changes Made**:
  - Security: Nonces in AJAX/admin, esc_* in outputs.
  - Perf: Batch size configurable, heartbeat for progress.
  - Debug: Empty import.log; added more logging.

## 2025-09-16 (Grok Conversation Update)
- Reviewed code vs. snippets: ~90% integrated; missing mappings.php, gzip handler, JSON support.
- Issues fixed: Added mappings.php, standardized names/constants, added JSON parsing, fixed missing functions.
- Modified files: processor.php, core.php, helpers.php, constants.php, main plugin file.
- Next: Test with real feeds (VDAB/Actiris), monitor logs, expand JSONL if needed.
- Learnings: Consistent naming prevents errors; use WP natives for gzip. Preserve snippets for reference in future.



- [2025-09-16] Initial setup of job-import plugin with hardcoded feed. Reviewed mappings/constants matching example 1.1.

- [2025-09-16] Modified job-import plugin to use 'job-feed' CPT for dynamic feeds. Checked mappings/constants â€“ they match snippet example 1.1. Updated processor.php, scheduler.php, helpers.php for loop processing, error handling, and deduplication. Updated structure.md accordingly. This improves scalability for multiple job sources in future iterations.
