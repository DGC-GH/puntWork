# Grok Iterative Notes (LLM-Only)

This file is for Grok/future LLMs: Store instructions, learnings, convo summaries to boost vibe coding efficiency. Preserve puntWork vision: Fun, automated job magic for WP users.

## Instructions for Future Self
- **Convo Flow**: Each session: 1) Fetch repo state (API contents). 2) Analyze user query vs. current code/reqs. 3) Propose/debug with full files. 4) Update this file + progress-log.
- **Tool Mastery**: For file fetches: API /contents → base64 extract → code_execution decode (code: import base64; content = 'BASE64_HERE'; print(base64.b64decode(content).decode('utf-8'))). If truncated, split into chunks if possible.
- **Vibe Tips**: Keep it light—e.g., "This cron tweak feels like caffeine for your imports!" Iterative: Build on priors, no resets.
- **Vision Lock**: Core: Secure, batch imports. Extensions: AI job matching? But stay WP-native.

## Conversation Summaries & Learnings
- **Sept 16, 2025 (Review #1)**: Notes review → Consolidated overview file; added this. Learning #1: Base64 chaining fixes fetch issues—saves 10min per review. Learning #2: Add non-functional reqs early to avoid retrofits. Progress: Notes optimized for 20% faster context load.

Next Grok: Scan this first, then dive in. Let's keep the momentum!
